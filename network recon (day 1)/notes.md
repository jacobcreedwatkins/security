# Penetration Testing

**There are 6 phases to penetration testing:**

1. Mission Definition
2. Recon
3. Footprinting
4. Exploitation and initial access
5. Post exploitation
6. Document Mission


#### Penetration Test Reporting

Two types of notes: **Operation Notes** vs **Formalized Reporting**

Two types of summaries: *Executive Summary* vs *Technical Summary*

# Passive Recon

`cat /etc/os-release` 	provides OS info

`lsb_release -a`  	provides OS info

`uname -a`  	print system information

`hostnamectl` 	print system information in a cleaned up format

# Exploit Databases

[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search)

^ This robust database from the National Institute of Standards and Technology from the US Department of Commerce contains a search function for CVE's

[CVE Index List](http://cve.mitre.org/cve/search_cve_list.html)

^ Essentially the same as the NVD

[Exploit Database](https://www.exploit-db.com/)

^ self explanatory, extremely helpful tool
